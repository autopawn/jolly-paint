;Palette Name: SARA-98C
;Description: Another palette in PC-98 specs: 16 colors in 12-bit RGB. This time it's whitish-orange skintones, reds, purples and teal, in that order of importance. All three ramps interlock in brightness and join at the dark end, the light end is yellowish/cream. I developed the palette in GrafX2 with heavy use of DawnBringer's palette analysis tool.
